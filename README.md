## 🛠️ How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Process:

1. **Enter Current Balances** - Your total credit card balances across all cards
2. **Enter Current Credit Limits** - Your total available credit across all cards  
3. **Choose Target Utilization** - Select 10% (optimal), 30% (acceptable), or enter custom percentage
4. **Get Results** - See exactly how much additional credit you need via AU tradelines

### 📈 Calculation Methodology

The calculator uses the industry-standard credit utilization formula:

```
Target Credit Needed = Current Balance ÷ (Target Utilization ÷ 100)
Additional Credit Required = Target Credit Needed - Current Credit Available
```
